        <p class="Paragraph">
          Real-time brain activity can be recorded in the form of electrical
          signals. This is usually done in human subjects and patients by
          placing electrodes over the scalp, a technique called
          electro-encephalography (EEG). This technique is quite analogous to
          ECG done for the heart. The signals thus obtained consist of various
          oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity and can give clues about the
          underlying brain states, structure and function.
          <br /><br />
          My research with Dr. Supratim Ray, Indian Institute of Science, has
          concentrated upon understanding such oscillatory activity, especially
          activity in visual areas of the brain that has a frequency of 20-70
          Hz.This activity is called visual gamma rhythm. This rhythm has been
          suggested to be observed due to network activity in brain and is
          correlated with various cognitive functions of the brain like
          attention and working memory. I studied this rhythm in healthy
          subjects as well as clinical populations.

          <br /><br />

          In visual cortex, narrow-band gamma oscillation is generated by
          specific visual images called Cartesian visual gratings. These are
          alternating dark and white bars presented on a computer screen while a
          subject stares at the screen (example seen in the figure to the
          right). Gamma rhythms traditionally were observed in the range of
          40-70 Hz in certain experiments in humans. However, no study
          previously has observed multiple gamma rhythms in visual cortex of
          humans, unlike in certain brain areas rodents. In my
          <a href="#JNeurosci2018">first study</a>, I had discovered a slower
          visual gamma rhythm (~20-40 Hz) that was elicited only by larger
          gratings (diameter more than 8° of visual angle). I had named these
          rhythms as slow gamma (and the traditionally known gamma as fast
          gamma). As mentioned above, slow gamma was observed only for larger
          images and had longer latency unlike fast gamma, suggesting the role
          of distinct networks in brain. <br /><br />

            showing changes in alpha, slow gamma, fast gamma and SSVEP at 32 Hz,

            An example stimulus (visual grating) is also shown and corresponds
            to the start (0 s) and stop (0.8 s) of its presence on the screen.
            For measuring gamma, we used stationary stimuli, and for measuring
            32 Hz SSVEP, we used gratings that phase-reversed at 16 Hz.</i

          Previous studies had reported correlation of gamma activity with
          cognitive functions in healthy adults. However, how these oscillations
          vary with healthy cognitive decline due to aging is not known. In my
          <a href="#NeuroImage2020">second study</a>, I found that both slow and
          fast gamma decreased in power with age in 227 cognitively healthy
          individuals aged 50-88 years. This age-related decrease was not due to
          non-neural factors like small jittery eye-movements (microsaccades) or
          noise during recording. <br /><br />
          I had also looked at two other oscillations: alpha (8-12 Hz) and
          steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) at 32 Hz. Alpha
          rhythms get stronger when a subject closes his eyes, and get weaker
          when he engages in activity (viewing images on computer screen in my
          case). I had noticed that these oscillations do not reduce with age in
          elderly subjects unlike gamma rhythms. However, SSVEPs in gamma range
          (32 Hz) do behave like gamma rhythms: these become weaker with age.
          These rhtyhms are generated by similar images (gratings), however
          these images "flicker on the screen" (technically, phase-reverse at 16
          Hz) instead of remaining stationary.

          Previous studies have found abnormalities in gamma rhythms in rodent
          nodels of neurodegenrative disorders like Alzhiemer's disease. I would
          hold on to the details of my clinical research till it appears on
          medRxiv. For an interim conclusion of my work, discussed in light of
          rodent studies, decline in gamma rhythm strength may be part of a
          continuum of ‘healthy cognitive decline - pathological
          neurodegenaration’ spectrum of aging process in humans.
