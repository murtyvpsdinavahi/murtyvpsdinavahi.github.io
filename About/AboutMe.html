        <p class="Paragraph">
          During my tenure as a PhD student at IISc, I taught
          <b>EEG</b> practical class for undergraduate students in the
          January-April session of 2016. I covered recording of EEG from human
          subjects and time frequency analysis of EEG data. This class was
          followed by assessment of students that included take-home assignments
          and viva examination. <br /><br />
          Besides, I had also taught <b>neuroanatomy</b> classes to
          undergraduate students in August-December sessions of 2015 and 2016. I
          had given them an introductory lecture on neuroanatomy, followed by

        <p class="Paragraph">
          I was a <b>Founder member of student chapter of SIAM-IISc</b> (Society
          for Industrial and Applied Mathematics – Indian Institute of Science).
          I also served as its secratary and coordinated in organising lectures
          and workshops in applied aspects of mathematics.

          <br /><br />
          I was a volunteer and executive committee member of
          <b>Note Book Drive</b>. It is a network of student volunteers from
          IISc and its sister institutes in Bangalore like NCBS. They work
          towards providing financial support and inculcating scientific
          attitude in school children of poor socio-economic areas of rural
          Bangalore. I was involved in various activities like mentoring school
          students, teacher training workshops, children's day celebrations,
          etc.

          <br /><br />
          Besides these, I was a <b>volunteer</b> for the

          workshop. I was also involved in managing activities on stage for our
          lab’s module in the workshop.

          <br /><br />
          At college, I worked as a <b>volunteer</b> (medical service) at
          Alamadhi (near Chennai), a rural out-patient Sunday clinic of Govt.

          at Stanley. At this facility, interns and residents see patients from
          the village of Alamadhi and prescribe medicines for minor illnesses,
          assisted by medical students. This helps the poor villagers save a lot
          of commutation time, money, energy and loss of work/pay for travelling
          to the hospital OPD on working days.
